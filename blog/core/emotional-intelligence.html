    <p>EQ measures someone's ability to recognise emotions in themselves and the people around them. It's about making decisions which 
      react positively to yourself and your peers. IQ measures someone's cognitive ability. It's about your ability to problem solve,
      use logical thinking, and approach complex problems.
    </p>

    <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
    <p>EQ is an important aspect of maintaining a healthy, well rounded life. It's beneficial in building relationships, 
      identifying and managing emotions, encouragement towards yourself and others, and reducing stress levels by thinking about your
      response to situations and feelings.
