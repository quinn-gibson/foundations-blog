      <h3>Three Things I've Learnt About Myself</h3>
      <p>I have learnt that it's important to understand yourself and others, I can learn anything I want to, and it's okay to get stuck. I think these
        are three key aspects to learning that aren't always emphasised by other institutes. We're there to learn our choice of course but the fundamentals
        of being a productive learner come from understanding how we learn best.
      </p>

      <h3>Values, Empathy, and Self-Awareness</h3>
      <p>Values, empathy, and self-awareness are important characteristics in both learning and programming. They allow us to work collaboratively with 
        our peers, and recognise things about our own learning, eg. when we need to work harder or give ourselves a break.
      </p>

      <h3>Core Learning Surprises</h3>
      <p>I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the core aspects of foundations. I found them really interesting and also encouraging as a learner.
      </p>

      <h3>Core Learning Challenges</h3>
      <p>I had no challenges with the core content. I just found them to be interesting topics to research.
      </p>

      <h3>Why I Think Dev Academy Focuses On Core Learning</h3>
      <p>Dev Academy is teaching us how to code, but also prepare us for a career. It's one thing to have the technical abilities, but being able to understand
        yourself and others is a crucial part to working collaboratively.
      </p>

      <h3>Core Learning Reflection</h3>
      <p>I think the core content was extremely useful as a learner. Touching on emotional intelligence and neuroplasticity was really encourgaing when coming
        across challenges in the technical content. I also found the core content to be a nice little break from the tech content, while still doing work for 
        the course.
