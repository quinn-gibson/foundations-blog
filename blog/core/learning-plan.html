    <h3>Long term goal</h3>
    <p>My long term goal doing this course is to get a job in the tech industry, specifically in software development. Having studied
      tech for a little bit before this course, I made the decision to join Dev Academy due to their practical, industry relevant approach.
    </p>

    <h3>Strengths and limitations</h3>
    <p>My learning strengths are that I'm committed and understanding. I like to fully immerse myself in everything that I do, and help
      others out where I can. My learning limitations can be my lack of reaching out for help if I get stuck, I will keeping searching for 
      answers on my own and not recognise when it's time to ask someone else.
    </p>

    <h3>Human skills I want to develop</h3>
    <p>I'm really looking forward to doing collaborative programming. All work I've done in past studies has been individual so I'm excited 
      to work with others.
    </p>

    <h3>How will I manage my workload</h3>
    <p>I have an approach to learning where I try to complete the bulk of a workload as soon as possible, so that remaining activities
      can be split up over how long I have to do them and it's not a big rush to get everything finished at the end. This means I have more 
      time to solidify my knowledge, either by helping others or diving deeper into areas I'm not as confident in. When it comes to other 
      learners, facilitators, and industry/community representatives, I enjoy being around others but I'm respectful of their time and 
      workspace.
    </p>

    <h3>Seeking help</h3>
    <p>In the past, I have sometimes left it later than I should've to ask for help. During foundations, I will use discord to contact
      my cohort/homegroup and facilitators, and during bootcamp I will have the option of in person help Monday - Friday.
    </p>

    <h3>Facilitation team expectations</h3>
    <p>The facilitation team have been amazing so far, reaching out to students before students reach out to them. I don't necessarily
      have any "expectations", just to be approachable in a supportive environment so it makes asking for help seem less intimidating.
    </p>

    <h3>Scheduling information</h3>
    <p>I don't have any other commitments that would take priority over Dev Academy. My permanent contract at work has been changed
      to a casual contract, and therefore I will only help them out when I have the time to do so around my studies.
