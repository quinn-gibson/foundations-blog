      <h3>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h3>
      <h3>Long term goal</h3>
      <p>My long term goal doing the Dev Academy course is to get a software development job. I don't have any idea what sort of company I want to 
        work for, but I want to work in NZ for the first bit before I potentially go overseas.
      </p>

      <h3>Strengths and limitations</h3>
      <p>My strengths and limitations from sprint 2 are still relatively the same. I'm committed to things I do but sometimes struggle asking for help 
        due to past experiences. I've gotten better with this during bootcamp, so I think my biggest limitation could be trying to adjust to moving cities, 
        the new part of the course etc.
      </p>

      <h3>Biggest non-technical challenge</h3>
      <p>This might sound a little silly, but I'm not a morning person. So I think my biggest non-technical challenge could be adjusting to a new 
        sleep schedule with early wake ups.
      </p>

      <h3>Human skills I want to develop</h3>
      <p>I'm looking forward to working with other people over bootcamp. I've done group work in past studies but usually everything was individual.
      </p>

      <h3>Bootcamp team expectations</h3>
      <p>I don't necessarily have any expectations of the bootcamp team. Just to be encouraging and approachable for help. The facilitation team 
        have been amazing so I don't have any doubt about bootcamp.
      </p>

      <h3>Expectations for myself</h3>
      <p>During bootcamp, I will seek help from my peers and the bootcamp team. I'm going to aim to get my work done Monday to Saturday so I have a free 
        weekend day to take time for myself and do things like groceries, washing etc. I like to think I'm a productive learner when it comes to tech 
        since it's a topic I'm interested in. I'll always be respectful towards other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
      </p>

    <div id="foundations-learning-plan">
      <h3>Foundations Learning Plan</h3>
      <h3>Long term goal</h3>
      <p>My long term goal doing this course is to get a job in the tech industry, specifically in software development. Having studied
        tech for a little bit before this course, I made the decision to join Dev Academy due to their practical, industry relevant approach.
      </p>

      <h3>Strengths and limitations</h3>
      <p>My learning strengths are that I'm committed and understanding. I like to fully immerse myself in everything that I do, and help
        others out where I can. My learning limitations can be my lack of reaching out for help if I get stuck, I will keeping searching for 
        answers on my own and not recognise when it's time to ask someone else.
      </p>

      <h3>Human skills I want to develop</h3>
      <p>I'm really looking forward to doing collaborative programming. All work I've done in past studies has been individual so I'm excited 
        to work with others.
      </p>

      <h3>How will I manage my workload</h3>
      <p>I have an approach to learning where I try to complete the bulk of a workload as soon as possible, so that remaining activities
        can be split up over how long I have to do them and it's not a big rush to get everything finished at the end. This means I have more 
        time to solidify my knowledge, either by helping others or diving deeper into areas I'm not as confident in. When it comes to other 
        learners, facilitators, and industry/community representatives, I enjoy being around others but I'm respectful of their time and 
        workspace.
      </p>

      <h3>Seeking help</h3>
      <p>In the past, I have sometimes left it later than I should've to ask for help. During foundations, I will use discord to contact
        my cohort/homegroup and facilitators, and during bootcamp I will have the option of in person help Monday - Friday.
      </p>

      <h3>Facilitation team expectations</h3>
      <p>The facilitation team have been amazing so far, reaching out to students before students reach out to them. I don't necessarily
        have any "expectations", just to be approachable in a supportive environment so it makes asking for help seem less intimidating.
      </p>

      <h3>Scheduling information</h3>
      <p>I don't have any other commitments that would take priority over Dev Academy. My permanent contract at work has been changed
        to a casual contract, and therefore I will only help them out when I have the time to do so around my studies.
