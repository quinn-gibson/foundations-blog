    <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
    <p>Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people greatly by giving them the knowledge that their brain can be 
      strengthened and wasn't prewired with limitations. Increasing neuroplasticity is done through experiences or memories - the more 
      something is done, the stronger the neural pathways are. I could incorporate the principles of neuroplasticity in my learning by 
      finding code challenges that are repeating the same aspect I'm practicing, eg. functions, loops, methods etc. I found 
      <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-brain-plasticity-2794886" target="_blank">this website</a> useful when researching 
      neuroplasticity.

    <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
    <p>Growth mindset is the idea that people look at their struggles and challenges as a way to improve and get better. Instead of focusing
      on what's going wrong, to focus on the things that are going well. This is relevant because we're all learning new things, and if we
      weren't praising the things we're doing well, we would soon run out of motivation. I've been exposed to the idea of a growth mindset 
      before, and although I don't have a fixed mindset that "I can't get better", I think I need to improve on recognising what I do 
      well more often. I found <a href="https://www.understood.org/en/articles/growth-mindset" target="_blank"> this website</a> useful 
      when researching growth mindset.
    </p>

    <h3>Learning Plan</h3>
    <p>I still stand by my learning plan and I'm getting more comfortable asking for help when it's needed. Having the exposure 
      to the concepts of neuroplasticity and growth mindset, I will try be more repetitive with areas I study to strengthen those neural
      pathways, and remember that things are always learning opportunities when I get stuck.
