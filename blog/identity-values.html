      <h3>Ethical decision making</h3>
      <p>A little bit about me to start. I've worked in hospitality since I was 15, and since being 18, this has included bartending. As some of you may be aware,
        The Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act can be a tricky thing to navigate with customers at times. There are different licenses that restaurants and bars can carry
        which allow for certain things that other licenses may not. One of the biggest that you've probably heard of is BYO. However, I've found the one I had the most
        trouble with was that if you buy a bottle of wine and don't finish it, our license didn't allow customers to take the wine home with them.</p>
      <p>One night, a very lovely couple asked for the bottle cap for their wine as they wanted to take it home. I was struck with the ethical decision of "the customer is
        always right" and our liquor license. Do I please customers or please the owner? </p>
      <p>In the end, I chose to get the duty manager on shift cause it wasn't my decision to make (but if it were then I'd abide by the liquor license).</p>
      <p>In reflection of this ethical decision, I would do things exactly the same again. I can feel how I feel about a situation but at the end of the day,
        if I had of made any decision besides make the duty manager aware of what was going on, then I wouldn't have been doing my job properly.</p>

      <h3>Culture and how the people around me have influenced my values and identity</h3>
      <p>I wouldn't consider myself to be a very cultural person, however the people around me have greatly influenced my values and identity.
        I have a select few friends that I'm extremely close with and because of this, the extent that we would go to for each other is amazing.
        I see myself as someone who cares greatly for those around me, whether we've known each other for years or only just met.</p>

      <h3>Strengths in my learning journey</h3>
      <p>I took a strengths test and that identified my top 5 strengths as kindness, humour, honesty, love, and judgement. I think these will benefit me in my learning
        journey by having a positive relationship with my peers. I love to have a bit of fun but I know how to work when there's things to be done.</p>

      <h3>Limitations in my learning journey</h3>
      <p>Sometimes I struggle to ask for help when there's things I'm not sure on. This could affect my learning journey by me getting behind on work cause I'm too 
        scared to seek help. However, I've found the Dev Academy environment to be extremely supportive and I don't think this affect me as much as it has in the past.</p>

      <h3>Working productively with others</h3>
      <p>The times I have worked with others and there was resistance or tension was due to clashing personality traits. I find it really helpful for the group to sit
        down before starting any work and make a plan. What is the end goal? What steps need to be taken to get there? What are your strengths? Weaknesses? Do you
        prefer to lead or follow? This has always worked really well , provided everyone is open minded to catch up and discuss how things are going - which could
        potentially lead to a change in approach. I find this strategy beneficial as it sets out everyone's roles, responsibilities, strengths, and weaknesses.</p>
