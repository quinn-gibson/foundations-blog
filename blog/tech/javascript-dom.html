        <h3>JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is the interactive aspect of a webpage. As if HTML were the skeleton, CSS were the  clothing, and JavaScript is 
          everything in between, eg. muscles, organs.
        </p>

        <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3>
        <p>Control flow is the order in which statements of code are executed. Loops are blocks of code that will be executed until
          a condition is met. We can understand this process as if we were emptying the dishwasher. The dishwasher would get opened,
          and then a loop of taking dishes out and putting them away would be done until the dishwasher is empty.
        </p>

        <h3>Document Object Model</h3>
        <p>The document object model, or the DOM, is a tree-like representation of a webpage's structure using objects. The DOM is created
           by the browser when a webpage is loaded, and is used by JavaScript to access and change elements of the webpage. You can access
           elements by using 'getElementById()' or 'getElementsbyClassName()'. ID returns a single element with that ID and class name 
           returns an array of elements with that class name.
        </p>

        <h3>Arrays vs Objects</h3>
        <p>Arrays hold a list of individual elements and accessing data from an array uses indexing. Indexing is using the name of the array
           followed by the element's index number in square brackets. Eg, fruits = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana'], accessing the apple 
           element would be fruits[0].
        </p>
        <p>An object has properties consisting of key value pairs and accessing data from an object uses dot notation. Dot notation 
          is using the name of an object and the key to access the value. Eg. a person object with the name Bob and age 27, accessing the 
          person's age would be person.age 
        </p>
          
        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <p>Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task and the code isn't run until it's invoked. Functions are 
          good for code reusability as you can perform the same task without having to write the code again in a different part of 
          the program.
        </p>
