        <h3>JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is the interactive aspect of a webpage. As if HTML were the skeleton, CSS were the  clothing, and JavaScript is 
          everything in between, eg. muscles, organs.
        </p>

        <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3>
        <p>Control flow is the order in which statements of code are executed. Loops are blocks of code that will be executed until
          a condition is met. We can understand this process as if we were emptying the dishwasher. The dishwasher would get opened,
          and then a loop of taking dishes out and putting them away would be done until the dishwasher is empty.
        </p>

        <h3>Document Object Model</h3>
        <p>The document object model, or the DOM, is a tree-like representation of a webpage's structure using objects. The DOM is created
           by the browser when a webpage is loaded, and is used by JavaScript to access and change elements of the webpage. You can access
           elements by using 'getElementById()' or 'getElementsbyClassName()'. ID returns a single element with that ID and class name 
           returns an array of elements with that class name.
        </p>

        <h3>Arrays vs Objects</h3>
        <p>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
        </p>

        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <p>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</p>
