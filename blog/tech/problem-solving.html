        <h3>Blocked on a Problem</h3>
        <p>I had a little bit of trouble when it came to using .map(). I just didn't really understand it too well at first.
            I tried googling it, and although it helped a bit, I still didn't fully understand how to use it to solve the kata problem.
            I was feeling a little frustrated cause I couldn't find anything online that explained it in a way I clearly understood. I ended
            up asking about it on discord and got some help. I learnt how to use it but I will still need more practice because sometimes
            the contents of the brackets stump me.
        </p>

        <h3>Solved a Problem</h3>
        <p>I enjoyed the super fizzbuzz kata. I feel like I used the logic of a squence diagram wihtout actually creating one.
            I've used functions before that rely on the return value of another function, so my thought process was just what each line of 
            code is actually doing, what information is being held where and at what points etc. I felt good while doing this kata, it's 
            fun when you're practice works out well.
        </p>

        <h3>Reluctant to Ask for Help</h3>
        <p>Going back to the first section where I was blocked, I was reluctant to ask for help when I was stuck on some of the latter 
            builtin methods. I'd done so much google searching myself and I still couldn't find anything to help me. I felt this way
            because I was nervous other people may have found it easy to understand and it could look like a silly question being sent 
            on discord. I went back and reminded myself of Dev Academy's 'how long you should be stuck for before you ask for help', sent 
            the message, and received some help.
        </p>

        <h3>Problem Solving Techniques</h3>

        <h5>Pseudocode</h5>
        <p>I'm fairly confident with the idea of pseudocode. I understand the benefits of it, I just need to practice actually
            writing it out instead of doing it mentally.
        </p>

        <h5>Trying Something</h5>
        <p>I am constantly trying out ideas that I have, and if it doesn't work then I'll do some googling and try something 
            else.
        </p>

        <h5>Rubber Ducky Method</h5>
        <p>I understand the concept of the rubber ducky method, but I'm yet to really put it into practice.</p>

        <h5>Reading Error Messages</h5>
        <p>I'm okay at reading error messages, it depends where they occur. I like them in the test files for example, where 
            it tells you the expected result and what it actually received.
        </p>

        <h5>Console.logging</h5>
        <p>I'm slightly less familiar with console.logging, I understand the output but I struggle with how to view it. I don't 
            always know where to see the output, eg. viewing it in dev tools, or on the terminal.
        </p>

        <h5>Googling</h5>
        <p>I'm extremely confident with using google to problem solve. I find myself searching something and I'm always drawn to 
            stack overflow, w3schools, and mdn.
        </p>

        <h5>Asking Peers</h5>
        <p>I'm getting more confident asking peers for help. I'm slowly less intimidated by the thought of them thinking it's a silly 
            question. We're all studying the same thing, and there will be some things I'm more confident with that they're not.
        </p>

        <h5>Asking Coaches</h5>
        <p>Kind of a similar response to above, all help messages are seen by both students and coaches. I really try to solve things 
            for myself, but I'm getting mroe confident sending messages on discord if I encounter errors that I don't understand how to
            rectify.
        </p>

        <h5>Improve With Reflection</h5>
        <p>I enjoy the reflections at the end of activities, it's a good way to notice things I may have struggled with and things 
            I did well too. Focusing on the positives and what can be improved.
