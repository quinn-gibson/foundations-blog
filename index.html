        <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Quinn. I'm 21 years old and I'm from Christchurch.</p>
        <p>I've studied tech for the last year and a half at Ara Institute of Canterbury. This started with a technical IT skills certificate in semester 2 of
          2021, and in 2022 I completed my first year of a information and communication technologies bachelor.</p>
        <p>I decided to come to Dev Academy because programming is my largest interest area in the tech world. I find it so intriguing how much there is to learn,
          and how many ways there are to do something. Although it can be frustrating at times, the feeling when everything works how it's intended to can't be 
          matched.</p>
        <p>When I'm not studying, you'll probably find me with my friends, my nephew, my dog, trying out new cafes and restaurants, or simply having a nap.</p>
        <p>9 times out of 10 it's the latter option.</p>
        <p>I think that's enough of an introduction for now, hope you enjoy browsing!</p>
